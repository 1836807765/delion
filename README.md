###Brief Introduction
---
* The main purpose is to share related issues and knowledge for Chromium for Android, which includes Chromium building, compiling and business implementation. Besides analysis and research of Chromium, it will try to create a useful and neutral instrumental product. Simple to use will be adhered. 
* At present, the project was built by Android Gradle and compiled with [GN](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/android_build_instructions.md#Faster-Edit_Deploy-GN-only) on the basis of [synchronizing latest tag code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/54.0.2789.1).
* Delion implies that the project is the seed of dandelion derived from Chromium. Hope it can take root and thrive in China adhering to the open source of Chromium, strong technique gene and propagation mission as a seed. At the same time, hope it also can share and spread out related knowledge, then used in more areas.


###The Purpose for Open Source
---
1.	The project is too large to be finished by one person. Although we are researching Chromium, hundreds of engineers from Google continue to submit codes. I am on the way of sharing my achievements. Therefore, I hope that more people take part in the research, then we can work and make progress together. (welcome to [view the project](https://github.com/derry/delion) and [my blog](http://blog.csdn.net/yangdeli888))
2.	Adhering to open source sharing, I will continue to develop the project without any commercial purpose and utilitarianism. I will burnish the browser to a neutral tool product. The first aim will be simple to use. Hope through open source, more people know and use this project.
3.	The browser development refers to wide technology and has high research value. For google, it is platform application and strategic product. Follow up his pace and continue to research and develop the program. Then we have access to first-hand technical data of Google and can use such a world-wide application frame. The results can be used for many other applications.


###Project Schedule (update continuously)
---
1.	[The project starts on July 2nd, 2016](http://blog.csdn.net/yangdeli888/article/details/51811169)
2.	Finish compiling and building of the source codes; delion project was born and open source on July 27th(based on 54.0.2789.1 Tag, GN compilation and Gradle building)
3.	[Continue to develop(step by step)](http://wwww.derryy.com)
